/* 
Butterfly'O Butterfly,
Our love is like a sweater,
Comfortable and familiar,
But sometimes torn and tattered.

We had an ice cream date,
After the tution that day,
The roads were crowded,
As we laughed and played.

You gave me chocolate,
On my birthday with such glee,
A sweet and thoughtful gift,
From you to me.

You are the paint,
That colors all my days,
A vibrant, lively hue,
That brightens all my ways.

But you are also the dandelions,
Blowing in the breeze,
Elusive and untamed,
Like a love that's meant to be.

Butterfly'O Butterfly,
Our love is a work in progress,
But I am willing to wait,
For the other half, I must confess.
