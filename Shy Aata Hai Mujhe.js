/*

Shy aata hai mereko, to express my feelings
To speak my heart, to reveal my dealings
The words get stuck, in my throat so tight
And all I can do, is stare into the night

Shy aata hai mereko, to open up to you
To share my thoughts, my dreams, my truth
But my fears, they hold me back
And all I can do, is simply act

Shy aata hai mereko, to take a stand
To speak my mind, to be more than a bland
But the doubts they creep, and the nerves they shake
And all I can do, is hide and quake

Shy aata hai mereko, but I know I must try
To push through this fear, and let my voice rise high
For in expressing myself, I'll find my strength
And that shyness, will soon be at length.
