/* 

Tereko hakal dunga mein, for all the pain you've caused
For all the tears you've drawn, for all the love that's lost
With every word, I'll cut like a knife
And you'll feel the weight of all your lies

Tereko hakal dunga mein, for the hurt you've caused me
For the way you played with my heart, so carelessly
With every verse, I'll make you feel the heat
And you'll know the devastation you've brought to my feet

Tereko hakal dunga mein, for the trust you broke
For the promises you made, that you never spoke
With every rhyme, I'll make you realize
The depth of the wounds, behind my eyes

Tereko hakal dunga mein, but through this pain
I'll rise above, and love again
For my strength, it lies within
And you'll be the one, left with the sin.
