/* 
Heart shattered and bruised,
All my feelings and trust abused,
Once in love with a girl so kind,
But she left me, love blind.

My heart yearned for her every day,
And my love for her wouldn't sway,
I was devoted, I was true,
But she betrayed me, what could I do?

I gave her all my time and care,
But in the end, she didn't seem to care,
She chose another, leaving me behind,
Leaving me with memories, so unkind.
The love I had, now turned to dust,
Betrayed by someone I thought I could trust.

Now I am left with a broken heart,
And every day is a brand new start,
To try to mend and move ahead,
And try to forget the love that's dead.

But in my heart, I'll always keep,
The memories of a love so deep,
The love I had for a girl so true,
But who left me alone, feeling blue.
