/*

The greatest pain that comes from love, 
is loving someone you can never have

You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.

I never loved you any more than I do, right this second. 
And I'll never love you any less than I do, right this second.

The person who loves you the most, 
is the person you will end up hurting the most.

You broke my heart, 
but I still love you with all the little pieces.

I don't know how to forget someone who gave me so much to remember.

Love is not something you go out and look for. 
Love finds you, and when it does, 
ready or not, 
it'll be the best thing to ever happen to you.

A heart that has truly loved never forgets.

Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I've ever done, 
but trying to let go of you will be the hardest.
